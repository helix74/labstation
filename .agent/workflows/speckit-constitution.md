# Speckit Constitution Workflow

1.  **Analyze Context**: Check if `constitution.md` already exists in the project root or `docs/` folder.
2.  **Gather Requirements**:
    - If the file exists, ask the user what sections they want to update or refine.
    - If the file does _not_ exist, ask the user for their core values, preferred tech stack, and architectural guidelines.
3.  **Draft/Update**:
    - Create or edit `constitution.md`.
    - Ensure it contains sections for:
      - **Core Principles** (e.g., User First, Simplicity)
      - **Tech Stack** (e.g., React, Python, Tailwind)
      - **Coding Standards** (e.g., Naming conventions, Testing rules)
      - **Workflow** (e.g., Spec-first, Review process)
4.  **Review**: Present the file to the user for approval.
