# Speckit Clarify Workflow

1.  **Context**: Ask the user which feature they want to clarify (e.g., "001-create-taskify").
2.  **Analyze**: Read `specs/NNN-slug/spec.md`.
3.  **Identify Gaps**: Look for ambiguous terms, missing edge cases, or unspecified tech choices.
4.  **Quiz**:
    - Generate a list of specific questions for the user.
    - Present them clearly.
5.  **Integrate**: Update `specs/NNN-slug/spec.md` with the user's answers.
