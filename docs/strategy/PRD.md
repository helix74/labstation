# Product Requirements Document (PRD) 📋

> **Project**: Lab Station Digital Experience
> **Version**: 1.0
> **Status**: Draft

## 1. Executive Summary

Lab Station is not just a fast-food restaurant; it is a "Culinary Laboratory". The website must reflect this by offering an immersive, "gaming-like" experience where the user enters a high-tech facility to discover "experimental" burgers and tacos. The goal is to create a "Haja Masaretch" (Never seen before) digital flagship.

## 2. Problem Statement

Current fast-food websites in Tunisia are generic, static catalogues. They fail to capture the excitement, the brand identity (Moudi Food), and the premium nature of the product. Users browse, but they don't _experience_.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

- **Brand Immersion**: Establish Lab Station as a high-tech, premium, and fun brand.
- **Engagement**: Keep users on the site longer through interactive elements (animations, storytelling).
- **Conversion**: Drive physical visits by showcasing the "Benna" (Deliciousness) through high-quality visuals and social proof.
- **Differentiation**: Be the #1 most innovative food website in Tunisia.

## 4. Key Features (The "Lab" Experience)

- **The Guide**: A 2D Hazmat Scientist character that guides the user (Loader, Hero, 404).
- **The Vibe**: Dark Mode, Neon Yellow/Green, Industrial textures, "System Boot" animations.
- **The Language**: "Derja-Tech" - A mix of Tunisian dialect and scientific terminology.
- **The Showcase**: A "Periodic Table" inspired (but unique) display of products as "Experiments".
- **The Proof**: Integration of +1000 Google Reviews to build trust.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Must load fast on 4G mobile networks (Tunisia).
- **Accessibility**: High contrast text, clear navigation despite the "immersive" style.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design (most users are on phones).
